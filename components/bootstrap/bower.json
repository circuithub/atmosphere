[Please open a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues). Before opening any issue, please search for existing issues and read the [Issue Guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines), written by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas/).\n\nYou may use [this JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/aKiCIDO/1/edit) as a template for your bug reports.\n\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nBootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com). The docs may also be run locally.\n\n### Running documentation locally\n\n1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v1.x).\n2. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.\n  - **Windows users:** run `chcp 65001` first to change the command prompt's character encoding ([code page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page)) to UTF-8 so Jekyll runs without errors.\n3. Open [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in your browser, and voil√†.\n\nLearn more about using Jekyll by reading their [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).\n\n### Documentation for previous releases\n\nDocumentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at [http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.\n\n[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.\n\n\n\n## Compiling CSS and JavaScript\n\nBootstrap uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) with convenient methods for working with the framework. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more. To use it, install the required dependencies as directed and then run some Grunt commands.\n\n### Install Grunt\n\nFrom the command line:\n\n1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.\n2. Install the [necessary local dependencies](package.json) via `npm install`\n\nWhen completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.\n\n**Unfamiliar with `npm`? Don't have node installed?** That's a-okay. npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.\n\n### Available Grunt commands\n\n#### Build - `grunt`\nRun `grunt` to run tests locally and compile the CSS and JavaScript into `/dist`. **Requires [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess) and [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).**\n\n#### Only compile CSS and JavaScript - `grunt dist`\n`grunt dist` creates the `/dist` directory with compiled files. **Requires [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess) and [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).**\n\n#### Tests - `grunt test`\nRuns jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/) (used for CI). **Requires [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/).**\n\n#### Watch - `grunt watch`\nThis is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save.\n\n### Troubleshooting dependencies\n\nShould you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun `npm install`.\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read through our guidelines for contributing to Bootstrap. Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.\n\nMore over, if your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you must include relevant unit tests. All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](http://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](http://github.com/mdo).\n\nEditor preferences are available in the [editor config](.editorconfig) for easy use in common text editors. Read more and download plugins at [http://editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org).\n\n\n\n## Community\n\nKeep track of development and community news.\n\n* Follow [@twbootstrap on Twitter](http://twitter.com/twbootstrap).\n* Read and subscribe to the [The Official Bootstrap Blog](http://blog.getbootstrap.com).\n* Have a question that's not a feature request or bug report? [Ask on the mailing list.](http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-bootstrap)\n* Chat with fellow Bootstrappers in IRC. On the `irc.freenode.net` server, in the `##twitter-bootstrap` channel.\n\n\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/).\n\n\n\n## Authors\n\n**Mark Otto**\n\n+ [http://twitter.com/mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo)\n+ [http://github.com/mdo](http://github.com/mdo)\n\n**Jacob Thornton**\n\n+ [http://twitter.com/fat](http://twitter.com/fat)\n+ [http://github.com/fat](http://github.com/fat)\n\n\n\n## Copyright and license\n\nCopyright 2012 Twitter, Inc under [the Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n",
